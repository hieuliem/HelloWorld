		Father of lights,<br>
		the radiance of your Son has guided the advance of the Gospel<br>
		across the Diocese of Richmond for two centuries,<br>
		strengthening our Church<br>
		from the waters of the Eastern Shore to the mountains of the Blue Ridge.<br>
		Grant that the nearness of your Son may dispel the darkness of our sins,<br>
		so that as our love increases more and more,<br>
		we may dare more than ever to proclaim the word fearlessly.<br>
		Holding fast to the word of life,<br>
		may we shine like stars in the world.<br>
		We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,<br>
		who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,<br>
        one God for ever and ever.
